v1.1.0
-------

* Add an option to depart from a legacy behaviour where the eligibility endpoint would not raise RequestErrors on 4xx
  and 5xx errors. The default is to keep the original behaviour so as not to break existing implementations.
  New implementations should call the endpoint with a second argument set to `true` and try/catch RequestError
  exceptions to better handle error cases with eligibility:
  ```php
    try {
      $eligibility = $alma->payments->eligibility($data, true);
    } catch (RequestError $e) {
        // Handle errors
    }
  ```
* Add fields and docs to the Payment entity
* Add a Refund entity and extract refunds data within the Payment entity constructor
* Add the `feePlans` endpoint to the `merchants` scope, so that one can fetch "fee plans" configured for their merchant
  account: `$alma->merchants->feePlans();` â€” see function's docs for available options
